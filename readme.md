## To run locally
To get the element loading to work, you can't just open the html file, as the game sends out web requests to get the txt files. To solve this you must run a local http server. Heres some options on how to do that

- Easy way: [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
- Recommended Way: Use Node.js Scripts.
- Other way: Use Python http.server

## Node.js setup
Install Node.js, then run in a terminal
```
npm i -D
```
then to start a web server, run
```
npm start
```
then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

To run tests (spellcheck and style guide)
```
npm run test
```

## Python setup
### Python 2:
Windows: py -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
*nix (macOS): python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
### Python3:
Windows: py -m http.server 8080
*nix (macOS): python3 -m http.server 8080
